## Functionality
- [X] - **Basic raytracing** - Implementing core raytracing algorithms & tracing a sample scene composed of spheres.
- [X] - **Light** - Implementing light sources & light illumination into the sample scene.
- [X] - **Shadows and Reflection** - Implements the interactions between the light sources and scene objects.
- [X] - **Extending the Raytracer** - Arbitrary camera positioning, performance, subsampling etc.

### Extra functionality
