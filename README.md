![example render](tracer_example.png)
A simple raytracer in C, using only the Win32 API. Implements the pseudo-raytracer as illustrated in the first chapter of [Computer Graphics from Scratch](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/).

## Functionality
- [X] - **Basic raytracing** - Implementing core raytracing algorithms & tracing a sample scene composed of spheres.
- [X] - **Light** - Implementing light sources & light illumination into the sample scene.
- [X] - **Shadows and Reflection** - Implements the interaction between the light sources and scene objects.
- [ ] - **Extending the Raytracer** - Arbitrary camera positioning, performance, supersampling etc.

### Extra functionality
